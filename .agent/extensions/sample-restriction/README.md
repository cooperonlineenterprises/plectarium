# Sample Restriction Extension

This enabled, domain-neutral reference extension demonstrates the stable
extension protocol. It can only add path restrictions, has no external side
effects, and grants no permission.

The registry may set `enabled` to `false`; the kernel remains valid and does
not require code changes. Replace or remove this extension during
project-specific adoption only after the disable-path test continues to pass.
